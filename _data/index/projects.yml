I help create processes that remove impediments in the CI/CD pipelines for large scale agile infrastructure deployments. I am currently working as a consultant with Equal Experts. A hard working, highly motivated self starter, I strive to develop and understand my field. I am passionate about Linux, open source projects, development and cybersecurity. I understand that the difference between a good engineer and a great one is empathy."
